Tutorials and information for using TACC
========================================

The Texas Advanced Computing Center, or [TACC](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/home), is an organization within the UT System that provides computational resources for research and teaching. These resources are used by researchers throughout the United States to perform advanced and computationally intesive analyses that would be difficult or impossible to complete on other computers. 

The documentation in this repository is for new TACC users who may have little or no experience with remote computing and no formal training in computer science, and is explained with plain language and minimal jargon. Extensive technical information about TACC is available on their [training website](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides), and appropriate information will be linked in subsequent pages. In particular, information about operating Stampede can be found [here](https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/environment/default).

###Resources available
A variety of resources are available, including high performance computing (HPC), data visualization, and data storage. Most of this documentation will reference [Stampede](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede), the largest and most widely used computer cluster at TACC.

###Should you use TACC?
If you are conducting analyses that involve large data files or require large amounts of processing/memory, your laptop or desktop computer may not be able to handle your analysis. Additionally, some software is only available for particular types of computers, or is difficult to install on your own machine. Some examples of common tasks in bioinformatics include (but are not limited to): next-generation sequencing data analysis, genome assembly/annotation, phylogenetics, and ecological modeling.
